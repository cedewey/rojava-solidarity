Atom About Extra

Description:
The Extra modules perform tasks that are not safe to include directly in Features code due to the possibility of overwrites.
The Atom About Extra module contains code to force the defaultcontent module to perform creation tasks. This appeared necessary earlier in development, but has been commented out. If the Atom About Feature does not properly create the About page, try uncommenting this module's code.

Caveats:
